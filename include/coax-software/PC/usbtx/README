These programs are used to send data to the gumstix over the serial port.
It is assumed that the files gumstix/usbrx and gumstix/base64-decode are in the path, 
possibly in /usr/bin

Usage:

On the gumstix, start the listener:
#> usbrx > destination
or
#> usbrx destination

On the PC, send the file:
#> usbtx source /dev/ttyUSB0
or 
#> usbtx source
/dev/ttyUSB0 is the default

On the gumstix, press Ctrl-D when the transmission is finished (usbtx returns)
